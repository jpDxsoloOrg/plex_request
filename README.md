# Plex Request

A serverless media request application built on AWS that allows users to search for movies and TV shows and request they be added to a Plex media server. Approved requests are automatically sent to Radarr (movies) or Sonarr (TV shows) for download and processing.

## Overview

Plex Request provides a self-hosted, Overseerr/LunaSea-style workflow where authenticated users can browse and request media, while admins manage an approval queue and track request lifecycle.

### How It Works

1. **User searches** for a movie or TV show (powered by TMDB API)
2. **User submits a request** which enters a queue with status `requested`
3. **Admin reviews and approves** the request
4. **On approval**, the app calls the Radarr or Sonarr API to add the media and trigger a search
5. **Admin updates status** as the media progresses: `requested` -> `approved` -> `downloading` -> `complete`
6. **Users can track** their requests and see current status at any time

### Request Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `requested` | User has submitted the request, awaiting admin review |
| `approved` | Admin approved; sent to Radarr/Sonarr |
| `downloading` | Media is being downloaded |
| `complete` | Media is available on Plex |
| `rejected` | Admin denied the request |

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript Lambda functions
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito, S3, CloudFront)
- **IaC**: Serverless Framework
- **External APIs**: Radarr v3 (movies + search), Sonarr v3 (TV shows + search), SABnzbd (download status - stretch goal)
- **Auth**: AWS Cognito with user self-registration and admin role

## Features

### User Features

- View personal request history with status tracking
- User registration and login via Cognito

### Admin Features
- View all pending requests in an approval queue
- Approve or reject requests
- Update request status (downloading, complete)
- Manage Radarr/Sonarr connection settings
- View all users and their request history
